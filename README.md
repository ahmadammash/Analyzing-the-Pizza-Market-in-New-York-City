# Analyzing-the-Pizza-Market-in-New-York-City
This project uses an NYC restaurants database to help a client who is considering opening a pizza restaurant in NYC.

Using a JSON file which contains a list of dictionnaries where each dictionnary contains information on a particular existing pizza restaurant in NYC, I was able to generate insights from the dataset through building effective visualizations that would help the client in making evidence-based decisions on what to focus on in order to succeed in launching their new pizza restaurant in the city.

The client had a number of hypothesis on the average restaurant ratings in NYC, their reveiew counts, price points, location and zipcode. The dataset and insights helped either prove or disprove the client's hypotheses and come up with conclusions on how to maximize the value generated from opening a new restaurant in NYC.
